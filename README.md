# Firebase-Train

This project was interesting given it is more accurate compared to the MTA train schedule! One issue I had encountered was getting the moment.js library to work. After reviewing some class materials, I discovered that the issue was due to some minor punctuation in my code. I also spent a good amount of time in styling the page and making it look neat. Need something more reliable than the MTA app on your phone? Look no further!
